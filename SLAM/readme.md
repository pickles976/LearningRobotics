# SLAM implementation from scratch

## TODO:
- [ ] Finish Bag of Words dictionary
- [ ] Implement Loop Closure
- [ ] Use Loop closure to optimize pose graph
- [ ] Clean up
- [ ] Add 3D reconstruction


## BAG OF WORDS:
- [x] K-means clustering
- [x] Histogram generation
- [ ] ~~TFIDF scoring~~
- [ ] Return closest match brute force
- [ ] Apply LSH
- [ ] Compare prior similarity
- [ ] Detect loop closure

This folder consists of me following along with the SLAM book english translation in Python
